**ESG Risk Assessment and Engagement Recommendations**

**1. Climate Change and Natural Resource Scarcity:**

Climate Change and Natural Resource Scarcity: The portfolio companies face physical risks from climate

change, such as damage to infrastructure, disruption of water supply, and increased storm risks.

a. Conventional Food Corporation (CFC): Risks to distribution infrastructure and natural

resource product inputs due to climate change.

b. Downtown Developers Inc. (DDI): Coastal location puts assets at risk of physical damage

from flooding, hurricanes, and storms.

c. Premier Products (PP): Climate change impacts on distribution infrastructure pose a direct

risk to customer product distribution.

**2. Labor Management:**

Risks associated with the management of the labor force include potential negative behaviors or incidents

affecting brand reputation, reliance on public transportation that may be impacted by climate change or labor

strikes, and high turnover rates affecting customer satisfaction and order fulfillment accuracy.

a. Limited transparency and reporting on ESG governance, strategy, risks, and opportunities.

b. Risks to corporate reputation, valuation, and access to capital for all three companies.

The assessment of ESG risks for the three-company portfolio highlights the significance of climate change and natural

resource scarcity, labor management, and transparency and reporting as key areas of concern. To effectively manage

these risks, engagement objectives focused on climate change strategies, employee engagement and welfare, supply

chain management, product safety and customer welfare, and transparency and reporting are recommended. By

proactively addressing these areas, the portfolio companies can mitigate risks, enhance their sustainability

performance, protect their reputation, and position themselves for long-term success in an increasingly ESG-focused

business environment.

**III. ESG Risk Assessment and Engagement Recommendations:**

The assessment of ESG risks for the three-company portfolio reveals the key areas of concern: climate change

and natural resource scarcity, labor management, and transparency and reporting. The portfolio companies

face physical risks from climate change, including infrastructure damage and disruption of water supply. Labor

management risks involve potential negative incidents affecting brand reputation, reliance on vulnerable

transportation systems, and high turnover rates. Limited transparency and reporting on ESG issues pose risks

to corporate reputation, valuation, and access to capital. To effectively manage these risks, engagement

objectives should focus on climate change strategies, employee engagement and welfare, supply chain

management, product safety and customer welfare, and transparency and reporting. By addressing these

areas, the portfolio companies can mitigate risks, enhance sustainability performance, protect their

reputation, and ensure long-term success in an ESG-focused business environment.
