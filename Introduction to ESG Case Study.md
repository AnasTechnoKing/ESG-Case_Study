Assessing ESG Risks

You are a financial analyst asked to provide your assessment of an investment

portfolio’s risk exposure, and to specifically assess the risks of three different

companies in three different industries. You will be provided some basic information

on each business to inform your analysis.

You will be asked to provide insights into company risk exposure, in addition

to providing recommendations on engagement principles that could support

the management of these risks across the portfolio. You will specifically be asked

the following:

• What do you think are the top material ESG risks facing the three-company

portfolio?

• In terms of investment stewardship, what kind of engagement principles

would you recommend to management? In other words, what investor

objectives could help lower risk exposure across the portfolio?

Conventional Food Corporation (CFC)

CFC is a food distribution company that sells their own proprietary brands produced

by private label manufacturers. They have three product categories, including

branded bottled beverages, produce, and baked goods. Their distribution network

heavily relies on third-party subcontractor drivers, totaling approximately 65% of

their total drivers. The extent of their current ESG efforts include donating baked

goods to bake sales at local schools and employee volunteerism days. Information

on these efforts is anecdotal in nature, written in single sentences on their website.

Downtown Developers Inc. (DDI)

DDI is a commercial real estate development corporation that has had great success

in providing mid-priced, premium office space to up-and-coming tech start-ups in

metropolitan areas. Their largest project to date has been a downtown office park

in a hip tourist neighborhood that brushes up against near the coastline. DDI’s

construction labor force, primarily comprised of recently immigrated new citizens,

live inland from the coastal construction site, and rely on public transportation to get

to the construction site each day. DDI knows tech companies think sustainability is

important, and to satisfy their customers, they plan to install LED lights in all the new

units of the office park. Their website mentions “eco-friendly” building supplies and

appliances as demonstrative demonstration of their commitment to sustainability.
